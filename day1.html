    <h1>Formatted Content with Paragraphs and Rules</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 13px;">This is the first paragraph of the content. It provides an introduction to the topic being discussed. The paragraph is formatted with proper indentation and spacing to ensure readability and a clean layout.</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: 13px;">This is the second paragraph. <br>
        This is useful for creating a list or emphasizing separate points within the same paragraph.
        It includes a line break, <"line break here"><br>
        which is used to break the content onto a new line without starting a new paragraph.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: 13px;">
        This third paragraph follows the second paragraph. It contains more information on the topic,<"line break here"><br>
        and uses line breaks to structure the content<"line break here"><br>
        into clear, readable sections.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: 13px;">

    <h1>Using Quotation and Citation Tags in HTML</h1>
    <p>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>
    <blockquote>
         "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving."<b> //this is blockquote text</b>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say: <b>//this is paragraph</b></p>
    <p><q>To keep your balance, you must keep moving.: <b>//this is blockquote text</b>
    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <cite>Albert Einstein</cite> : <b> //this is a citation teg.</b></p>
    <p>
  In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example, if you're referencing a famous work like 
  <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite><b> //this is a citation tag </b><br>by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.
</p>

<p>
  Another classic example can be seen in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite><b> //this is a citation tag </b><br>
  by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy 
  intertwine to create a timeless story.
